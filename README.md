## Description

My motivation is to create a working note taking application.

I built this project for users to easily create, store, and delete notes using Express API. 

This creates a webpage that utilizes both front-end and back-end features to create a functional note taking application.

I learned how to utilize Express and (somewhat) Heroku.

## Installation

The application webpage is: link.

Or you can download or fork this package. From there, open the integrated terminal (this is for VSCode) and run the following: 1. 1. `npm i`, 2. `npm run start`. 

## Usage

When you hit the landing page, click the "Get Started" button. You'll be redirected to the Notes page. From there, you can type in your note (**NOTE:** must include both a title and text body to save), and then select the save icon to save your notes. The note will be added to the left-hand column, where you can select your note to view it. 

To delete your note, select the trashcan icon next to the desired note. And use the **+** icon to add new notes.

Selecting the "Note Taker" title in the corner will redirect you to the landing page.
